#+title: Submodule: Udemy Clone with Bootstrap and SCSS

* About
This is submodule of my studying notes which were released as a public project in order to show it as part of a bigger portfolio, in this submodule I portrait the fourth website design I learned to create by following the tutorial in the Bootstrap course made by the Mexican programmer and designer Juan Pablo De la torre Valdez in Udemy.
+ Course Name: Boostrap 5 y SASS - La Guia practica - Crea 10 sitios

* Deployment
[[https://xandro2021.github.io/UdemyCloneBootstrapSASS/][Github Pages Link]]

* Interesting things learned in this Project
** Modify custom bootstrap variables
+ You can find all the modified values at _custom.scss
+ It is a way to change the default values in bootstrap variables, it will help to change the default appearance and save time and code in order to get your desired design
** Modify Margins or Paddins
+ In order to modify the default margins or paddings in bootstrap is necessary to look for $spacers in _variables.scss
** Modify Bootstrap Grid (Row-Cols)
+ The mixin to add the .row behaviour is called make-row
+ The mixin to add the .col behaviour is called make-col-ready
+ The mixin to modify the column grid from its default -12 is called make-col
#+begin_src scss
.listado-cursos {
    @include make-row;

    .curso {
        @include make-col-ready;

        @include media-breakpoint-up(sm) {
            // Create two columns where every element will required one column
            @include make-col(1, 2);
        }

        @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
            // Create three columns where every element will require one column
            @include make-col(1, 3);
        }

        @include media-breakpoint-up(lg) {
            // Create five columns where every element will require one column
            @include make-col(1, 5);
        }
    }
}

** New Grid in Bootstrap
+ There is a new bootstrap class alternative to d-grid that came its own subclasses that result in a similar behaviour than the default row/col system and more complex than the default d-grid
+ You must activate before being able to use by using the variable
#+begin_src scss
$enable-cssgrid: true;
#+end_src
+ It contains some subclasses for its children and the behaviour is exactly as the default row/col bootstrap system but using grid-layout instead of flexbox
  + g-col-6, g-col-md-4, g-col-lg-3
#+begin_src html
            <li class="g-col-6 g-col-md-4 g-col-lg-3">
                <a href="#" class="text-decoration-none">
                    <div class="bg-light">
                        <img class="img-fluid" alt="Imagen Icono" src="build/img/iconos-08.png" />
                    </div>
                    <p class="fw-bold mt-2">Musica</p>
                </a>
            </li>
